            <p class="quote"><i>I was a little nervous at first because I have never used a boarding service before. I have always trusted family members to care Sammy while I'm on a business trip. I took the plunge and boy was I pleasantly surprised. Everyone was so friendly and reassuring. I had to be away for about a week and half, which is pretty long time for being away from him, but the Pets-r-Us team was great with my dog. They took good care of him and sent me an update to put me at ease, while I was away. 10 out of 10! I will be using this service again.</i></p>

            <p class="quote"><i>My dog has never looked better! My little Rufus has unruly curly hair, so maintaining it has been a challenge on my own. I've had terrible experiences in the past with groomers, but the Pets-R-Us groomers are the real deal. His hair was so shiny and soft. They managed to makes his curls look so beautiful, I almost didn't recognize him. Their grooming services have been added to my dog's care routine.</i>></p>
